# Transport DAO


Transport DAO is a decentralized application platform that leverages Web3 tools and AI to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transportation management system. By utilizing smart contracts, Transport DAO enables the automated execution of transportation agreements, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the agreed terms without the need for intermediaries. The platform offers features such as real-time tracking of shipments, automated payments upon delivery, and dispute resolution mechanisms, all powered by blockchain technology. This ensures trust, reduces administrative overhead, and enhances the overall efficiency of the transportation process.


Web3 + AI tooling

Solana (emerging tech Web3 solution): 

We are developing a NeonVM utiliy token (Park Pro Token) using Neon transfer SDK, Open Zeppelin and enabling Smart incentivization using both Solana and Ethereum, Gnosis Pay with QR code dapp, EtherCalc.

We are integrating the Park Pro Token with EtherCalc where we are maintaining a list of vehicle service providers (Ethercalc link of vehicle service providers: https://ethercalc.net/veg1fcob7fe3)

Demo Video: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1twBmTFMY4N-ccA_n44dhWI5XfiE7igFU

We are also developing a lottery incentivization dapp for improving Web3 user adoption on Solana for Park Pro token: please find the vercel link at https://solana-lottery-dapp-rouge.vercel.app/

We are using Neon transfer SDK and NeonVM utiliy token (Park Pro Token) to enable:
- Effortless DeFi and NFT integration for a decentralized financial future.
- Securely send and redeem Solana and Ethereum tokens with an expiry for redemption.
- Purchase Ethereum based tokens using credit and debit cards, as well as various crypto assets for South Asian countries where the majority of tokens cannot be withdrawn from exchanges to wallets.
- Seamless management of fiat and crypto payment options across desktop and mobile platforms.
- User-friendly interface for convenient navigation and control over your digital assets.




Filecoin and AI; Privacy in AI data

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, and precision maintenance at the warehouse. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Warehouse Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for warehouse service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

FVM enables us to develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for warehouse monitoring and incident management using Filecoin eco-system tools.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for Warehouse service providers and Data DAOs on Filecoin Virtual Machine:

Warehouse DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance using work orders on the dapp. Warehouse service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created on FVM. Warehouse service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them. Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before. Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before. This is done by storing the previous vote's CID in the file of the newest one. Therefore a chain of verifiable data is created.


Galadriel: We are using Galadriel to develop an AI agent for incident summarization during supply chain management and logistics services and for managing fraud detection and insurance inventory management at the location. This enables incident management and early stage detection of goods and equipment insurance issues in case of an incident.

Workflow and Core Objectives for building Warehouse AI agents on Galadriel devnet:

Decentralized platform for logistics incident reporting and summarization by employees and contractors.

Community-driven approach to improving warehouse safety

Integration of advanced technologies for incident summarization, detection and prevention.

Smart incentivization using QR code dapp, EtherCalc.





Trusted AI development using Filecoin, Lilypad and Coophive

We are developing a Warehouse Equipment NFT and a Service/Repair Work Order NFT for preventive maintenance at the warehouse on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM / FEVM) using Coophive, Lilypad with Bacalhau Stable Diffusion. This is utilized for developing warehouse service and work order flows, enabling preventive maintenance via integration with alarm clock dapp and logistics scheduler for heavy goods using inter-state trains.
