Revolutionizing Sustainable Mobility; Road Safety

Opportunity: Enhancing road safety through smart incentivization of incident reporting by citizens.

Problem: Rising road incidents and the need for early detection and prevention by better incentivizing citizen developers. Ability to sustain citizen initiatives by decentralized QR code based affiliate marketing for merchants.

Solution: AAVE Blockchain-based ecosystem focused on sustaining citizen initiatives on road incident prevention using GHO stablecoin, Family Wallet and Chainlink CCIP integration and Chainlink Functions for spare parts dynamic NFT.
 
Core Objectives:
Decentralized platform for incident reporting and summarization by citizens. 
Smart incentivization using GHO stablecoin, Family Wallet and Chainlink CCIP integration with QR code dapp.
Community-driven approach to improving road safety backed by AAVE protocol.
Integration of advanced technologies for incident summarization, detection and prevention.

Pay using Family Wallet built using Connectkit supporting integrations AAVE protocol and GHO stable coins, Chainlink CCIP.
- Effortless DeFi and NFT integration for a decentralized financial future.
- Securely send and redeem GHO based stable coins with an expiry for redemption.
- Purchase Ethereum based tokens using credit and debit cards, as well as various crypto assets for South Asian countries where the majority of tokens cannot be withdrawn from exchanges to wallets.
- Seamless management of fiat and crypto payment options across desktop and mobile platforms.
- User-friendly interface for convenient navigation and control over your digital assets.



We are developing a facilitator for the Aave GHO ecosystem to tackle both challenges of citizen participation for reporting road incidents and better incentivization for citizen developers focused on safe mobility solutions:

- Collaborative Decision by Aave Governance
This enables determination and allocation of a Facilitator to a specific Bucket capacity to enable bootstrapping of GHO liquidity and the GHO market.

Facilitator
- This role enables generation and burning of GHO tokens in a trustless manner;
- Each Facilitator is allocated a Bucket with a specified Capacity;
- Using Ethereum or Ethereum based ERC20 tokens as collateral for GHO; 
-  Collateral can be provided cross chain via Chainlink CCIP to mint GHO;
- Citizen is able to ERC20 tokens as collateral and they can send their assets (collateral) to Aave protocol to earn an interest.
- Cross chain interoperability using Chainlink CCIP.

We are also developing Mile Wallet built using Connectkit, Chainlink CCIP, AAVE protocol and GHO stable coins: 
- Effortless DeFi and NFT integration for a decentralized financial future.
- Securely send and redeem GHO based stable coins with an expiry for redemption.
- Purchase Ethereum based tokens using credit and debit cards, as well as various crypto assets for South Asian countries where the majority of tokens cannot be withdrawn from exchanges to wallets.
- Seamless management of fiat and crypto payment options across desktop and mobile platforms.
- User-friendly interface for convenient navigation and control over digital assets.
